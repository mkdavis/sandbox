RALEIGH, N.C. â€” With significant snow in the forecast, the North Carolina Department of Transportation says its priority is clearing off major roads and highways first. That can mean delays of days until secondary and neighborhood streets are passable.

Central North Carolina could see up to 7 inches of snow fall beginning Friday night and into Saturday. The National Weather Service issued winter weather advisories for most counties in central and eastern North Carolina through 7 p.m. Saturday.

"We're expecting road conditions to deteriorate late (Friday night)," said WRAL's Brian Shrader. "Overnight, it's going to become very dangerous to travel."
